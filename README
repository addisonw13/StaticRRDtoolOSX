This is a self-contained build environment that creates a statically linked set of RRDtool 1.4 binaries (rrdtool, rrdupdate and rrdcached).

The binaries are built for i386 architecture only, with Mac OS X 10.5 set as the Deployment Target. 

Some minor font and pango configuration is installed into /usr/local/etc but all other libraries are built as static libraries, linked against statically and then removed after the build process. This leaves you with a set of RRDtool binaries that are not dependent on any non-system .dylib library. 

All library dependencies are included in their original form as separate .tar.gz to ensure compatibility.

Xcode is required to build the binaries on Mac OS X. 

This build environment has been tested under Mac OS X 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard) using Xcode 3.2.5
