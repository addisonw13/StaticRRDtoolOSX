This is a self-contained build environment that creates a statically linked set of RRDtool 1.4 binaries (rrdtool, rrdupdate and rrdcached).

The binaries are built for i386 architecture only, with Mac OS X 10.5 set as the Deployment Target. 

Some minor font and pango configuration is installed into /usr/local/etc but all other libraries are built as static libraries, linked against statically and then removed after the build process. This leaves you with a set of RRDtool binaries that are not dependent on any non-system .dylib library. 

The resulting rrdtool binary is linked as follows:

$ otool -L ~/rrdtool 
/Users/jwilson/rrdtool:
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.1.4)
	/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.3)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Carbon (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 136.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 32.0.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 476.19.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/ApplicationServices (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 34.0.0)

All library dependencies are included in their original form as separate .tar.gz to ensure compatibility.

Xcode is required to build the binaries on Mac OS X. 

This build environment has been tested under Mac OS X 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard) using Xcode 3.2.5
